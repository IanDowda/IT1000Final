   <p>
     Living in Missouri has been a great experience so far. My wife and I hope to live here permanantly. Given the large agricultural influence here and the rise in technology in that field, I'm somewhat hopeful to find a career here in technology service for farming equipment. This state seems like a good place to bring up a family. If my degree in <b>Information Technology</b> doesn't work out I plan to return to this college for a <i>Masters degree</i> in Library Sciences.
