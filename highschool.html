   <h1>My High School Career</h1>
   <h5><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> Home</a> </h5>
   <p>
    I attended school in <b>Aurora, Colorado</b> called <a href="https://vistapeakprep.aurorak12.org/" target="_blank"> Vista Peak Preparatory</a> from 2010 to 2014. The school introduced into the district a varied class structure. Beyond the general education classes an option for <i>'specialization'</i> or <i>'pathway learning'</i> was introduced. The options were:
    <ul>
      <li>Art</li>
      <li>Business</li>
      <li>Medicine</li>
      <li>S.T.E.M.</li>
    </ul>
    I chose the S.T.E.M path and learned a lot while I was there. I was introduced to 3D printing, AutoCAD and even hardware assembly through soldering.<br>
